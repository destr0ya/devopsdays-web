During this presentation I will describe Kubernetes features that help to reduce the maintenance cost of running containerised applications. After a really short refresher of basic Kubernetes concepts I will explain scheduling hints, probes, auto-scaling and automatic storage provisioning, and show how to use these mechanisms to make your deployments more robust and quickly adjust them to changing traffic or operational needs.

Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?
* This conference is about automation and this talk will show how to bring automation to production in the (probably) most popular container orchestration system.
