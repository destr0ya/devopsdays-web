There is a lot of discussion nowadays on how to use containers in production, are you there already? When operating a production platform we should prepare for failure and in addition to monitoring working metrics, we cannot forget about the most common failure points. From monitoring solution agnostic perspective, and following a use-case driven approach, we will learn the most common failure points in a Kubernetes infrastructure and how to detect them (metrics, events, checks, etc).
