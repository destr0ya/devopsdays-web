People don't change culture...events do.

It's true that change is hard on those impacted by it and equally hard to initiate.

As leaders we must constantly create the appropriate opportunities that allow our team members to experience what it is like to Create change first hand.

We can leverage Agile Lean and DevOps (ALDO) principles (ALDO) to help build and grow a better workplace (and better software), using sound DevOps practices.

ALDO principles can be used to underpin significant organisational transformation and we can't expect our people to achieve awesomeness on their own!

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?

It hits the topic of culture perfectly
