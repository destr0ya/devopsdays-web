DevOps culture and tooling has led to a giant shift in the way engineers build and release their apps/infra.

This transformation often comes at a price. Many firms focus on siloing security away from DevOps and do not bring security in early in the application development process.

SecDevOps helps!

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?

As more and more companies are making the shift from on-premises to public cloud; the standard approach to DevOps is evolving.

From encryption, compliance and regulations like GDPR, security in the cloud has become a hot topic. Many DevOps-agile companies have hired dedicated staff to fulfill these requirements, often creating further siloes, complexity and cost.

This presentation aims to highlight existing DevOps cultural approaches, tooling and how security can be wrapped in every facet of the build and release cycle and how to get sales and customer facing resources wrapped in.

Scott will share real-life experiences working with customers at Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services and explain how focusing on ‘security first’ transformed their business from product ideation to creation.
