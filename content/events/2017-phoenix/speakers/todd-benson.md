For over 20 years I have worked in IT operations, network and end user support, development, security, and DevOps for companies ranging from family owned pool builders, to Insurance companies, to the Federal government. I am currently implementing automated security into the DevOps pipeline for an Insurance company while building their security program and teaching developers and Enterprise security to play nice with each other.
