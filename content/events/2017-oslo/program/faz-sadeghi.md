It has become clear that the integration of security objectives into DevOps processes is just as important as the integration of other business objectives. There is an economic argument, as well, because fixing a software issue in production is much more costly than fixing it in the development stage. Integrating security early also helps organizations meet goals by reducing the time IT groups spend remediating security issues. This talk will define a reference implementation of DevOps from the ground up, by illustrating how the software delivery process evolves at a hypothetical startup. Once we've laid a technical foundation for DevOps, we will discuss the implications for security.
