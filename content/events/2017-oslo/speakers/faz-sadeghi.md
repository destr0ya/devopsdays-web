After spending a number of years in support and sysadmin, Faz finally settled for a technical solutions engineering role with Puppet in 2016. She graduated with a degree in Computer Systems Engineering, carried on working in IT and later on completed a MSc in Advanced Computing Technologies. Outside work and sometimes at work, she enjoys standing on her head, a bit of quiet time to find some head space and working towards completing a yoga teacher training program. Same as a lot of other women, she finds it very difficult to talk about herself and this task is quite a challenge for her right now.
