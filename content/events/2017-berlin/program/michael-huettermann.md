In this session we’ll set up a holistic Continuous Delivery pipelines with the use of DevOps enabler tools. We’ll quickly code and package an example Java web application. Its development versions will be inspected with SonarQube (the Code) and Xray (the Binaries), shipped with Docker, and deployed to Artifactory. Jenkins 2 with its native delivery pipeline features serves as a backbone of our delivery ecosystem. Final releases are published to Bintray, the distribution management platform. Operations (e.g. downloads) on the final releases are monitored by Bintray and the ELK stack (via JFrog Firehose Events API). After this interactive, demo-driven session, you know tips and tricks of setting up a Delivery Pipeline, using Cloud, microservices, and container technologies.
